# Notes made for the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)

### Autograd engine:
- -> Automatic Gradient
- Implements backpropagation:
    - iteratively tune weights of neural network to minimize loss function
    - improves accuracy of network
- Neural networks are just mathematical functions & calculations

### About Micrograd
- micrograd is technically all you need to train networks
- However, it isn't really much of complex coding ( basic python + a bit of calculus kekw )
- All you need to understand neural networks; Everything else is efficiency
- Fundamentals

### other notes 
- No actual math in Neural Network codes
- Just to know what derivative is measuring, aka. instantaneous slope
