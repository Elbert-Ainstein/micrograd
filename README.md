# The micrograd

This is essentially the replica of [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy)'s Micrograd. However, I have added plenty of notes in [Notes.md](https://github.com/Elbert-Ainstein/micrograd/blob/main/notes.md) for people who either don't have enough time to watch the entire 2h 25min lecture, or just for revision. Hopefully this helps.
