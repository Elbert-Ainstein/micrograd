# The micrograd

This is essentially the replica of [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy)'s Micrograd. However, I have added plenty of notes in [Notes.md](https://github.com/Elbert-Ainstein/micrograd/blob/main/notes.md) for people who either don't have enough time to watch the entire 2h 25min lecture, or just for revision. Hopefully this helps.

- Jupyter notebook in github to let you check out the product.
- Andrej's jupyter notebook is [here](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero/blob/master/lectures/micrograd/). It's more completed and detailed.
